      <h1>Seeking Guidance</h1>
      <h5>August 21st, 2023 - Ben Phillips</h5>
      <img src="Images/Aurelius.jpg" alt="Bust of Marcus Auerlius">
      <p>“Don't be ashamed of needing help. You have a duty to fulfill just like a soldier on the wall of battle. So what if you are injured and can't climb up without another soldier's help?” – Marcus Aurelius. <br><br> Being quick to ask for help when necessary is never a bad policy.  Of course, when facing an issue try your best to figure it out for yourself. However, tearing your hair out in frustration or being ashamed of requiring help over something that can be avoided with some guidance is never worth it. <br><br> Over the 6 months in Coder Academy’s Full Stack Development course I have run into countless obstacles. I've never hesitated to ask for help and fortunately for me the lecturers were always eager to lend a hand. In my first Junior Dev Role, I plan on carrying on this policy that has served me very well thusfar so I can become the best developer I can be. In the future, I can return the favour to another young Padawan…  </p>

        <h1>Positivity</h1>
        <h5>August 14th, 2023 - Ben Phillips</h5>
        <img src="Images/positive_thinking.png" alt="Positive thinking image">
        <p>Everything works out in my favour. Every failure, every success, every setback, every goal, every mistake, everything works out in my favour. Though I might not be able to see it immediately, God has a plan that is being fulfilled and everything that is happening, whether ‘good’, or ‘bad’, is part of that plan. So, I try not to fight with the plan by labeling things as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ but rather as what ‘is’ and I thank God that I’m even alive to experience these things. <br><br> If you have the idea that nothing is working out in your favour that is the reality that you will manifest. You will look for and dwell on all the mistakes and failures and thus create more of them by giving them your thought energy. Rather, instead of dwelling on mistakes, we must remember Napoleon Hill’s words; “Within every setback or obstacle or disadvantage there is the seed of an equal or opposite or greater advantage or benefit.” Let your thought energy water the ‘seed of benefit’ and let it grow. Once I started to practice identifying the seed in every circumstance then the way I perceived ‘setbacks’ radically changed for the better. They begin not even to seem as setbacks, rather as milestones along the way to my ultimate success. See the bigger picture. <br><br> Since adopting this mindset every ‘obstacle’ I have encountered has been like water off a duck’s back. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming… </p>

      <h1>My Mindset</h1>
      <h5>July 11th, 2023 - Ben Phillips</h5>
      <img src="Images/mindset.png" alt="Image illustrating good vs bad mindset">
      <p>I am convinced that IQ or being ‘naturally smart’ has just about zero impact on one’s capability to learn anything. Throughout my education I tried and tried to achieve good marks in that field we call ‘Mathematics’ and time and time again I would receive middling marks and I would pin it on my natural disinclination towards the subject. <br><br> Flash forward a couple years and I’m going strong 4 months into an accelerated coding course that I would never have seen myself doing some years ago. So what changed? Mindset! Mindset! MINDSET! Before, when I would blame my maths skills on my “natural disinclination” I was really just programming myself into believing that I couldn’t change it - “I’m just not good at maths” I would say, thus perpetuating my problem. Of course I could never improve my marks when I had this mindset! <br><br> The main shift in my mindset was that I truly internalized that everything is a choice. We choose what reality that we experience via our thought energy. I’d like to share some of the things I’ve been doing to ‘program myself’… <br><br> Whenever I have a negative thought – I quickly catch myself and cancel it out with a positive thought. If I start to think “I can’t do this”, I counter it with “I can do this with ease” – simple as! <br><br> Gratitude - If I am not busy I will intentionally think of things to be grateful for. Genuine gratitude radiates positive energy and can only serve to benefit. <br><br> Curating what media I consume – specifically music. Music is an incredibly powerful medium and its power to influence our thoughts should not be ignored.  The past few months I have intentionally cut out any negative music and have replaced it with positive music. <br><br> Prayer – focusing on my relationship with God. “According to your faith, be it unto you”. Whether you have faith in God or not – this principle applies. <br><br> Embrace the process – I now perceive any challenge that comes my way as a learning opportunity to be embraced, thus, I’m radiating positive energy and making the challenge easier to solve. Before, I would tend to become frustrated in the face of obstacles and create negative energy making the obstacle harder to overcome for myself. <br><br> Positive affirmations - I aim not to make broad claims like "I am successful" though. It must be specific. I strive to feel the affirmation while repeating it too to really internalize it. A favourite of mine right now is "learning to code is coming very naturally to me". I've said it and felt it so much now that I really believe it!! <br><br> If I could re-do secondary school with the mindset I have now... I'm positive that I'd be a maths wiz-kid!</p>

    <h1>Thoughts on Problem-Solving</h1>
    <h5>July 1st, 2023 - Ben Phillips</h5>
    <img src="Images/Rubix-Cube.jpg" alt="Problem-Solving image">
    <p>Ask any tech professional what the most valuable skills to have as a programmer are and 99% of the time 'problem solving' will be mentioned. I'd like to briefly share what my mindset in problem solving is and how it has helped me learning to code thusfar. <br><br>
      What my current approach to problem solving essentially boils down to is simply perceiving whatever "problem" comes my way as a mere trifle. Say I have a bug in my code, first I detach myself from the problem and don't get emotionally invested in the outcome. Being detached does not mean that I'm not distracted or not focused, rather, I'm taking control of the situation by standing back from the problem so I can have clarity of mind. I remind myself, there is ALWAYS a fix to a bug and that I WILL find it. I then calmly proceed to try to fix the bug as if I was simply walking to the supermarket to buy some milk, it's not a struggle, I simply just do it. And once I fix the bug? Pat myself on the back, celebrate the win, because this positively reinforces the mindset and subsequently makes all future bugs easier to fix. <br><br>
      The majority of the time using this mindset the solution comes to me easily. It has been an immense help in fixing the thousands of bugs that I've encountered so far and I'm positive it will help me in the thousands I have yet to solve. </p>
